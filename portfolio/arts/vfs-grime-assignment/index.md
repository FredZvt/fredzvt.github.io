Although the VFS program that I attended was called Programming for Games, Web and Mobile, the course included some classes that taught us about arts, sound and even business and team management. It is a very complete program that aim to prepare us to be able to create our own game studio.

In one of the Design Tools classes, our instructor <a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/leotalento" target="_blank">Leo Talento</a> asked us to take some images and apply grime, dirt anb graffiti to it using other images that we could create by ourselves or find on internet. I liked the result, so I'm posting it here. It was very fun to do this assignment.
