Although the VFS program that I attended was called Programming for Games, Web and Mobile, the course included some classes that taught us about arts, sound and even business and team management. It is a very complete program that aim to prepare us to be able to create our own game studio.

In one of the audio classes, our instructor <a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/pub/steve-royea/22/aab/446" target="_blank">Steve Royea</a> asked us to record our own voice and apply effects to it using Adobe Audition. I got excited and decided to record the introduction monologue of Thriller, from Michael Jackson, and compose with a background music and sound effects. Lots of laughs doing this!

Use headphones!
