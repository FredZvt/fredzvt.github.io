I made this Windows Console Pong in C# for the final assignment of the Programming 1 class on the end of the first term.

You can <a href="https://bitbucket.org/fredzvt/consolepong/src" target="_blank">get the code</a> or <a href="https://bitbucket.org/fredzvt/consolepong/downloads/ConsolePong.exe">download a compiled binary</a> on Bitbucket.

Below you can see a video of the game, but the frame rate of the recording is horrible.
