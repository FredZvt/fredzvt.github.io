## Arts

I create programs and games professionally and arts by hobby. I've always loved all kinds of arts! I play with 3D since the old DOS days with Autodesk 3D Studio R4, I did a lot of animations in Macromedia Flash when it was just an animation tool and I started my career as a web designer before diving deeper into the code side. Here you'll find some of my right side of the brain's deviations.
