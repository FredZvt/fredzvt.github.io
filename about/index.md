I've been a software engineer for over two decades, and for the past ten years my focus has been on game development for PC, VR, and mobile platforms using C#, C++, and engines like Unity, Unreal, and a few custom ones. I'm experienced working both on-site and in fully remote teams, and my workflow is grounded in agile practices and SCRUM.

I'm highly quality-driven and care deeply about building software that's fast, reliable, modular, and scalable. I take pride in quickly understanding complex requirements and turning them into clean, effective solutions. What drives me is the constant pursuit of better ways to create games, exploring new techniques, solving tough technical challenges, and pushing every project toward lasting, sustainable success.
