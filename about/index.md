Hi, fellows!

I'm a Brazilian guy that was lucky enough to be presented to computers graphics and video games at a very young age and quickly felt that being a programmer was something that I would love to do for the rest of my life!

I started my career as a web designer at early 90`s doing fancy web sites on my HotDog HTML editor, abusing of colors, animated gifs, blinks, marquees, flash splash pages and all the awful design trends of that magical time. But it didn't took long for me to go deeper and start doing simple web applications, mostly using ASP and databases. By the time that Microsoft created the .NET framework I was already a professional web developer and as such I participated in lots of different projects in many companies of all sizes. But, even though I always enjoyed being a web back-ends developer, my deepest dream always was to be a games developer. Very unfortunately, Brazil was not a good place to pursue this career.

By the middle of 2014, I decided to go for the big dream of being among those who creates the amazing games I enjoyed so much for so many years and moved to Vancouver, Canada, to attend to the <a href="https://vfs.edu/programs/programming" target="_blank">"Programming for Games, Web and Mobile" program at Vancouver Film School</a>. It was an amazing and very challenging year. I made lots of new friends, met legendary game developers, visited studios that created some of my favorite games and, most of all, created my own games! It was everything that I was hoping for, and beyond!

Now I'm a professional game developer at the start of my new career and decided to create this website to show my experiments, games and make some thoughts public. I hope you enjoy them as much as I enjoyed to create!

Cheers!
