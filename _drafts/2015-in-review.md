title: 2015 in Review
---

So, that's Christmas time! The end of 2015. The year that was so intense to me that felt like more than one. The year I started to live my dream of working in the gaming industry. I still feel amazed with that! Something that I always wanted since my childhood.

It all began by the middle of 2014, when I seriously decided to pursue this dream for real and started to look for strategies on how to make it a reality. It didn't took long for me to realise, yet again, that pursuing this dream in Brazil would be way harder, unfortunately. Another thing that was an unfortunate confirmation is that, even though I had years of experience in software development, this years almost don't count when changing the focus from web development to games development, they are two very different styles of programming. Of course that programming languages syntactic knowledge and good practices on architecturing object oriented software are still very useful but the way that web servers work are very different than the way that games work, also you need much more attention to performance and this requires a deeper understanding of the low levels and the use of C++ is usually prefered instead of high level languages like C#. So, a good way to get my feet on the door was to go back to school and accept the fact that I was starting a new career. Also, going back to school was the easiest way to get a visa to go abroad to get knowledge and get to know the right people that could offer me a good job position after graduation.

After a while researching the school options around the world I decided to apply for a position in the <a href="https://vfs.edu/programs/programming" target="_blank">"Programming for Games, Web and Mobile" program at Vancouver Film School</a> after reading a lot about the course, the faculty, testimonials from provious students and verifying the games industry and community around Vancouver. The application required that I handled my resume, a technical portfolio to show previous projects that I had worked on and an english test by phone. I received the letter of acceptance after a week. It wasn't easy to arrange the funds and the necessary visas for me and my wife in time, but miraculously everything worked out. Nothing on this process was easy, the decision, convincing my wife and myself that everything would be paid off, deciding to go away from my family and friends. It was a very stressful time for me, but I was decided.

And there I was, finally in Canada! I headed up three months before my wife and , it doens't show on the pictures but it wasn't a very easy time time for me. I spent some time in a cheap hostel while looking for an afordable more definitive place to stay. I was feeling happy by being there but at the same time very homesick and alone. I have to thank Marcelo Teixeira, a brazilian friend I met there, and the bike I bought a lot by being my best friends at that time. Cheers, Marcelo!
