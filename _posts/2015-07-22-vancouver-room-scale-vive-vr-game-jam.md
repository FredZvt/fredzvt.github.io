During the last weekend I participated in the Vancouver Room-Scale Vive VR Game Jam in the Centre for Digital Media.

Valve, HTC, NVIDIA, Epic, Unity, Cloudhead Games and Radial Games were present to support the jammers, talk about VR, what's next for the industry and just hang out. I met a lot of cool people there!

It was the best game jam I have ever participated in! It was very well organized, the support was amazing and it was just a lot of fun!

The HTC Vive is mind blowing! The immersion is incredible! Even better than my previous experiences with Oculus DK2.

I was the programmer in a team with <a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/jarvisgibb" target="_blank">Jarvis Gibb</a> (Game/Level Designer) and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benspialter" target="_blank">Benjamin Spialter</a> (Level/Mission Designer) and we created the game Legolas Simulator 2016, a small but very fun survival game where you stand on a tall tower and have to defend it against incoming enemies by shooting them with arrows before they reach your tower. The enemies come from all directions which forces the player to constantly check all sides of the tower. Their spawn rate increases over time, making the game harder every second. The bow and arrow mechanic worked surprisingly well and is very rewarding when the enemies are hit.
